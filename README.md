**Learn to build scalable monorepo and a complete Angular app using Apollo, Lerna, and GraphQL**

## What is this book about?
Angular is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in modern web app development allowing developers to not only build apps and reuse the code but also develop apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile, and native desktop, GraphQL is the modern and REST alternative for querying web APIs. Using Angular, TypeScript and GraphQL will give you a future-proof and scalable stack you can start building apps around.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Create a monorepo project with Lerna and NPM workspaces
* Add realtime support with GraphQL subscriptions
* Build a frontend with a modular architecture and Material Design UI components to consume the GraphQL API
* Use GraphQL Code Generator to generate types and code for a type-safe and scalable code base
* Create Angular modules and smart and dumb components and share data between them
* Use Apollo Client features such as client-side queries and reactive variables for local state management
